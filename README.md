# jackbox-games

A simple script that selects a random jackbox game based on the number of players from a curated list of favorite games.
Will ommit some games if the number of player is odd or even.

## Future work

Improvements to UX. The game list is curated based on my parties preferences, I would like to add the functionality of being able to select your own game list.
The user is presented with the __entire__ game list and tick boxes to make their selection.

I would also like to add a settings button to adjust some preferences, for example, the app current ommits some games from being chosen based on if the player count is odd or even (this is to ensure fair and even teams), give the user the ability to turn off this feature in the settings.
